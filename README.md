Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. This project is to explore prevalence of different mental disorder for some wealthiest and some poorest countries. 
We are also exploring Disability adjusted life years for same countries as well. We have demonstrated use of BAR plot, line plot and T-test for analyzing data. 

1. Dependencies and setup- Importing modules and libraries
2. Reading Data sets/csv file
3. Plotting DALYs as a Result of Mental Disorders by Country
4. Plotting linear regression relation between Disability adjusted life years vs years for choosen countries.
5. Plotting percentage of population by different mental disorder for several countries
6.Plotting trend of %population with disorders by countries
7. Calculation of T-test for schizohprenia, Bipolar disorder, Eating disorders, Anxiety disorders, Drug use disorders, Depressive disorders, Alcohol use disorders and Disability-Adjusted Life Years for US and UK to compare the results.

**Research Questions**

Are wealthier countries mentally healthier than others?
Based on first plot of disability adjusted life years, we could say that wealthier countries has more mental disorders than other poor countries. However we see that there is one odd observation. Suriname which is considered poor country has higher disability adjusted life years than other poor countries. Other factors could also affect this studies such as wealthy countries have the money to track the number of people that seek mental health which might not even been offered in poorer countries.
So it is hard to come to conclusion regarding this without considering some other facts/data into analysis.

What mental disorders are most prevalent?
Most prevalent mental disorder for each countries are anxiety and Depression. 

T-test results to compare various disorders between US and UK:
Average suffering with Schzophrenia, eating disorder, anxiety, Drug use and Depression in the United States is higher than the United Kingdom.
The population percentage in the UK suffering from bipolar disorder and alcohol use is higher than the population percentage in the US.
The Disability-Adjusted Life Years is higher in the US than the UK.
